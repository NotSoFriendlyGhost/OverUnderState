VEX Robotics 38535A - "Over Under" State Championship Code

This repository contains the complete C/C++ source code for VEX Robotics Team 38535A's robot for the 2023-2024 VRC game, "Over Under." This code was developed for and used at the Illinois State Championship.

About The Game: "Over Under"

The 2023-2024 VEX Robotics Competition, "Over Under," was a 2v2 game where robots scored acorn-shaped objects ("Triballs") into goals and by elevating themselves at the end of the match. This code contains all the programming for both the 15-second autonomous period and the 1:45 driver-control period.

Key Features of This Program

This program is built on the PROS framework and uses the EZ-Template library for advanced autonomous control.

Multi-Routine Autonomous: Includes multiple, selectable autonomous programs to account for different starting positions and alliance strategies.

Odometry-Based Navigation: Uses the EZ-Template library to integrate sensor data for precise and reliable odometry, allowing for complex, multi-step autonomous paths.

Driver Control Enhancements: Fine-tuned driver controls with custom button mappings and helper functions to make the robot intuitive and responsive during competition.

Subsystem Management: Clean, organized code that manages all robot subsystems, including the drivetrain, intake, and scoring mechanisms.

Tech Stack
